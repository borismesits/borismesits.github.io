					The APRS-strategy for balloon tracking turned out to be a good one.

					After launching at about 1:15 pm, we chased the balloon down Interstate 85 for a couple hours, stopped for lunch, 
					and then resumed shortly before the balloon descended. We had some scary moments with the Geiger counter not working 
					at launch, but it came online as it passed the 25,000 ft mark or so. Personally I think the new batteries
					installed just before launch changed the tuning of the high-voltage component in the Geiger counter, which disabled it
					until the battery voltage dropped a little. But for a few minutes, we did lose hope.
